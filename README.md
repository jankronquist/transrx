# Transducers + RxJava

Note: This is just a playground for experimentation!

After seeing Rich Hickey's presentation about [Transducers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mTbuzafcII) I started experimenting with applying transducers to RxJava. I got a simple example working with a stream of integers where I can apply `map`, `filter` and `mapcat` as transducers.
